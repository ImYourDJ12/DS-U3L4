1. The base cases are if the list reaches one thing in it or when the pointer is 
the thing your looking for.
2. Splitting the lists and moving the pointer.
3. The initial value of the pointer should be where the list is split. From there
it will either move one place to the left or one place to the right represented by
plus 1 or minus 1.
4. The maximum number of steps using binary search for this list is 4. Splitting 
the list then checking to see if it has found the number. A basic iteration search 
will take as many as it takes to find the number. In some cases that could be 1 
iteration or 9 iterations. While iteration searching could be faster in some cases,
binary searching is more reliable.
